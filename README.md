## Wolfenstein3d inspired Raycasting project

Final Score - 103/100

In this 42 project we are asked to extract information from a .cub file and use that information to draw a 3d maze on the screen using raycasting principles.

My Raycaster Project:

I believe this project has several challenges

1-Finding the right way to extract the cub information.
2-Parsing the cub correctly.
3-Using and understanding the minilibx drawing tool.
4-Understanding raycasting and the DDA algorithm.
5-Creating the bmp screenshot file.
